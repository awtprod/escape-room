Today, just like any other day, you find yourself walking down the street while taking instagram selfies. But then something strange happens.
You feel a rumble in your stomach. You think to yourself, that's strange my phone is in my hand. It then dawns on you that you've been taking
selfies for the past 8 hours and you only had a single slice of avocado toast for breakfast. Just then, you catch a whiff of cookies nearby.
Against your better judgment, you follow the scent to a strange but welcoming abode. When you get to the door, you find a note:

Greetings fool...I mean...welcomed guest,
Inside you will find a freshly baked batch of Chips Ahoy! cookies in the kitchen. This door will absolutely not lock behind you, leaving you 
searching my house for a key, most of which are useless, to free yourself. Oh! I also most definitely won't cast a spell on you where can't move anywhere
without dying unless you eat a cookie first. I don't know. I'm crazy. Also also, you can only hold, at most, 5 cookies and 3 keys at time. 
Also also also, if you're here for the seance, you have to enter from the door in the back. Again, welcome!
